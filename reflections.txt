You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned? Brief history of web, HTML syntaxes
  * What has been easy? Implementing some syntaxes
  * What has been difficult? Translating a mockup to HTML
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far? I learned that Google can be very helpful to find new HTML syntaxes and their usage.
